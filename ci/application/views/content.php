            		<p>New Zealand is a world class Fishing Location. Our waters are second to none when it comes to an incredible variety of fish species, including Snapper, trevally, terakihi, kingfish, kahawai, Gurnard, Blue Cod, blue moki, john dory, Hapuka and plenty more.</p>
            											
            		<p>We are also a first-class big game fishing location, as our seas are harbouring plenty of big game fish such as Marlin, sword fish, Tuna, and the Mighty Yellowtail Kingfish to name a few.</p>
            											
            		<p>And let’s not forget the superb trout and Salmon fishing in the pristine, shimmering lakes and rivers throughout our amazing country.</p>
            		<p>With over 15,000 KM’s of stunning coastline ( the 10th longest in the world) and the 4th largest fishing zone worldwide it’s no wonder over a million kiwis love to get out for a fish every year.</p>
